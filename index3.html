            <p>Not everyone goes through the same thing.</p><br>
            <p>Mental illness can be very isolating and that impacts your family, therefore amazing support is really necessary. People need to understand a bit about depression, anxiety, the prevalence of mental health issues and hear some interesting insights from someone with experience. <br><br>“I can sense when a depression or high is coming and change medications to lift or flatten me a bit. And the older you get, the less manic episodes you get.” -David<br><br>Reach out to someone if you think they need help. And reach out yourself if you’re not feeling well. Others could just be wanting to share stuff with others who've been through it. Don’t assume it is only you who feels nervous all the time. The initial anxiety can transform into a new beast, with depression and obsessive rumination at its core. Being lonely all the time and having very low levels of self-esteem also won’t help. After an initial diagnosis, the journey can be fraught with inconsistencies. Sometimes fitting in with the profile of the diagnoses given would be odd. <br> Life isn’t easy, for anybody. It is so important to treat each other with kindness and the respect they deserve. When we look at a person in front of us, we only see their face. We don’t see what’s behind: the memories, the experiences, the inner turmoil, and the victories. We need to change our perception of how we treat each other and be mindful of the fact that a lot more is beneath the smiling face you see in front of you. <br>Working hard for a year getting one’s depression and anxiety under control is making progress, but receiving a new diagnosis could feel like a step backwards. If journaling isn’t useful as it seems to make the problems larger in your head, then don’t do it, find another solution such as meditating.</p>
