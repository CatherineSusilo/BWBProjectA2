            <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInRightBig">Coping mechanisms are efficient methods of dealing with stress as long as they’re healthy. It is crucial that people put an effort into handling their stress, for stress does not completely go away if left alone; it hides itself at the bottom of the bottle and continues to grow until it overflows. It is also important to ensure that one copes with their issues healthily, and in a way that may not potentially make things even worse for them. Some coping mechanisms grant temporary release, seemingly getting rid of stress for a moment and eventually reeling it back in. These temporary releases can also feed your stress, thus making it grow into an even bigger and more complicated issue. Examples of unhealthy coping mechanisms include self harm, drug use, and alcohol consumption. <br><b>Below are what I find to be the three most effective and healthy coping mechanisms that may allow you to release the jammed tension in your brain: </b></p><br>

                <img id="pic" src="./img/Resting.png" alt="">
                <p>Resting and taking breaks after doing stressful activities allows you to set your mind back into a peaceful condition. Often people refuse to rest because they believe it is a sign of laziness and incompetence, however I assure you that needing some time off does not make you a lazy or incompetent person. Everybody needs rest, it is a basic human necessity that efficiently restores your concentration, regulates your mood, and gets your sense of rationality back in place.</p>

                <p class="con-title">Listening to Music</p>
                <img id="pic" src="./img/ListeningToMusic.png" alt="">
                <p>I’ve always believed that music is the language of the soul. Consisting of written lyrics, organized beats, and patterned tunes, music expresses feelings and stories in a way that is both artistic and feelable. Listening to music allows you to feel what you’re feeling. For instance, when you’re in a good mood you may listen to upbeat songs, and when you’re in a sad mood you may listen to slower songs with meaningful lyrics in them. The problem with a lot of people is that they neglect their feelings and sometimes refuse to feel what they want to. Music has the ability to bring out stuck emotions hidden within a person, thus allowing them to express and release stress. </p>

                <p class="con-title">Keeping Your Hands Busy</p>
                <p id="last">One of the worst ways to cope with stress is by doing self-harm. Self-harming does not only affect your physical well-being, but it also plays a big role in worsening your mental health. To avoid doing self-harm, it is important to keep your hands busy whenever you’re stressed. <br>A few activities are <b>knitting</b> and <b>crocheting</b>. Not only do these activities keep you engaged, but it also centers your attention onto something enjoyable, which helps reduce stress.</p>
